# Data-Analysis
Abstract
Sophisticated data analysis approaches, such as data mining, where the emphasis is on exploration and discovering new insights, are becoming more effective tools in
analyzing top sports performance data and aiding critical decision making. In this report, we look at the various data mining demands in the sports of Cricket in relation to a variety of variables that define the performances of Batsmen. The goal is to integrate the Cricket and data mining domains more structurally by (a)
establishing a framework for categorizing different metrics and (b) comprehending the analytical methods used to create a ranking system for the batsmen. As a result, we
examine the factors of performance analysis needs that impact each stage of Cricket data mining.
